# msc-template
LaTeX template for a Master's thesis. Originally created by the venerable Stig Elkj√¶r Rasmussen at the physics department of Aarhus University for Master's student graduation 2018. Uploaded here for longevity.

The mainA4.tex file compiles to a regular A4 print of the thesis, while the mainBook compiles to a nicely layouted bound book version.
